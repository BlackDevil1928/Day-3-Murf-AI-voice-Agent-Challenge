# Day 3 – Health & Wellness Voice Companion 🧘‍♂️🤖

Completed Day 3 of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge, and today I built a Health & Wellness Voice Companion that checks in with users daily through voice.

- 🔹 It asks about mood, energy, stress, and simple goals for the day
- 🔹 Gives grounded, supportive (non-medical) reflections
- 🔹 Saves every check-in to a JSON file (wellness_log.json)
- 🔹 Uses past entries to personalize future conversations
- 🔹 Powered by the fastest TTS API — Murf Falcon, making the voice interactions super smooth and natural

I also tested it in the browser and verified JSON persistence working end-to-end.
Excited to continue building more intelligent agents!
